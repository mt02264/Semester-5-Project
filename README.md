# Semester-5-Project
Image to Text

For now, there is no such description, except the one given below!

This project takes an image with some text written on it. It uses OpenCV and pytesseract together to obtain the text from the image using their deep learning algorithms. FInally, it writes the text into a text file or on another image, depending on user input. 

Moreover, it also works as a dictionary. You take an image of a word and then pass it as an input to this program, while along the way setting *meaning=True* in the project function in the main file.

Furthermore, it also works as a translator. You take an image with anything written on it and then specify the language you want your text to be converted into, and it does that. It also asks you whether you want to save your translated text in a text file or as an image.
